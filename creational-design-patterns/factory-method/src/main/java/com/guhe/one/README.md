# Factory Design Pattern

## Introduction

Factory Pattern is one of the Creational Design pattern and it’s widely used in JDK as well as frameworks like Spring
and Struts.

The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to
return one of the sub-class. This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client
program to the factory class. Let’s first learn how to implement a factory design pattern in java and then we will look
into factory pattern advantages. We will see some of the factory design pattern usage in JDK. Note that this pattern is
also known as Factory Method Design Pattern.
